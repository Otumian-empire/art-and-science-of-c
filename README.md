## Art-And-Science-Of-C-Codes
Reading and trying out the problems presented in the book Art and Science of C. I love what i am doing with it.

### Hindrances
* It seemed the maths used in the algorithms, chapter - 6 was over my head
* I have to install the graphics library myself - which i didn't in chapter 7
